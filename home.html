                  It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, 
                  diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and 
                    saturated and 
                      industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</b>
